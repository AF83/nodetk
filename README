## Setup
How to use these libraries / tools :

In your .bashrc (or whatever rc) file, set the bin dir in your PATH env variable:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/nodetk/bin

and the src dir in your NODE_PATH env variable:
export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/path/to/nodetk/src

You should then be able to use the nodetk modules with something like: 
var callbacks = require("nodetk/orchestration/callbacks");

You now have the following available commands:
nodetests [-v]
